    <h1>This baked mac and cheese is a family favorite recipe, loved by both children and adults. 
        It uses a combination of cheeses, layered in the dish as well as melted into a rich and creamy cheese sauce, 
        for the ultimate in cheesy deliciousness!  
        Perfect for a comforting dinner or as a holiday side dish!</h1>

    Baked mac and cheese.  It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have their favorite way of making it.

Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese (the way my family loves it too).
